  * calweek + int perhaps dangerous... because if calweekasint + int input
    instead, results in problems, and cannot prevent. require use of method like
    add_calweek_int; add_weeks; calweek + dweeks/weeks/intervals/etc., where
    latter arg is a special class? or try to warn if calweek+int is used in
    package or in batch but not in interactive? or warn (first time) in
    interactive as well?
